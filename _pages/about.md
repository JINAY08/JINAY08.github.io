Hello! This is Jinay, a final-year undergrad at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/). I am majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minors in Computer Science and Engineering. During last summer, I travelled to Switzerland for an internship under [Prof. Babak Falsafi](https://people.epfl.ch/babak.falsafi?lang=en) at [PARSA,EPFL](https://parsa.epfl.ch/) as a part of the [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/) internship program (acceptance rate of 1.5 %). At PARSA, I worked on the [ColTraIn](https://parsa.epfl.ch/coltrain/) project. Specifically, I worked on gradient-compressed HBFP for faster training of CNNs and LLMs. For more details, feel free to take a view at my [report](https://github.com/JINAY08/reports/blob/main/report_hbfpgc.pdf)

I am also a part of the nanoDC Lab, IIT Gandhinagar, led by [Prof. Joycee Mekie](https://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/), where I have worked on a variety of topics including approximate computing, Posit Number System, DNN Accelerators, and hardware security (PUFs). 

I am interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning from the algorithmic to the hardware level. During my research projects and internships, I have worked on ML hardware focused on DNN Accelerators. Do get in touch if you have also worked (or are working) in the domain :)
