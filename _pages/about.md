Hello! This is Jinay, a third-year undergrad at IIT Gandhinagar. I am majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minors in Computer Science and Engineering. During this summer, I am travelling to Switzerland for interning under [Prof. Babak Falsafi](https://people.epfl.ch/babak.falsafi?lang=en) at [PARSA,EPFL](https://parsa.epfl.ch/) as a part of the [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/) internship program (acceptance rate of 1.5 %). At PARSA, I am working on the ColTraIn project.

I have also been a part of the nanoDC Lab, IIT Gandhinagar, led by [Prof. Joycee Mekie](https://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/), where I have worked on a variety of topics including approximate computing, Posit Number System, DNN Accelerators, and hardware security (PUFs).
